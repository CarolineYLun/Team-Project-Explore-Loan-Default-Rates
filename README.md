# Loan-Default-Lending Club-Financial-Credit-Analytics
* Project Title: Assessing Credit Risk in Peer-to-Peer Lending
* Problem Definition: We seek to explore the likelihood of default in peer-to-peer lending based upon the financial and credit strengths of a sample set of borrowers. Using a dataset of peer-to-peer loans made through Lending Club from 2007 through 2020, we will benchmark base characteristics of a performing borrower, and identify how changes in attributes will impact the likelihood of loan default.
* Tools and languages: Big Query-SQL, Google Cloud, Jupytor Notebook, Python
